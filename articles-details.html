                           urrently, the numbers of participants in clinical
                           studies are low. Studies show that there is a myriad
                           of reasons for these low numbers. But, some of the
                           largest determining factors are the overwhelming
                           amount of possible trials, the lack of ability to
                           sort and find related trials, and the difficulty in

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        Clinical trials or interventional studies are
                        experiments conducted in clinical research. These trials
                        study how human subjects react to certain biomedical or
                        behavioral interventions such as vaccines, drugs, and
                        treatments. They are also meant to test reactions to new
                        ways of using already known drugs and treatments. Their
                        purpose is to determine if these interventions are safe,
                        efficacious, and effective. Clinical trials require
                        approval from their relevant countries prior to their
                        start. This approval does not mean that the intervention
                        being tried is safe just that the clinical trial can
                        begin. In fact in the US, only approximately 10% of
                        drugs which started in clinical trials on humans are
                        approved by the FDA. The process for developing new
                        drugs takes on average 10 years. The clinical trials
                        alone last six to seven years. This lengthy timeline is
                        one reason why there is so much planning put into
                        conducting a clinical trial. Normally trials run in four
                        phases. The first three are the most important phases
                        where the number of human
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        participant goes from a small group to several hundred
                        or thousands. With many trials, in the early stage, a
                        number of healthy participants are needed to test if the
                        medicine or the intervention can be tolerated. In
                        further stages, the clinical trials need patients who
                        are affected by the condition, which the intervention is
                        designed to address. This is needed because more precise
                        measurements are required for the dosage and the timing.
                        There are many specific requirements based on the nature
                        of the condition being studied and the finding the right
                        group of volunteers. It takes months or even years to
                        find suitable volunteers, this is especially true for
                        trials which are focused on rare diseases or those
                        focused on children where a number of legal and ethical
                        questions arise regarding participation. The last phase
                        is designed to monitor the effect on the whole
                        population and possible side-effects in widespread
                        usage. This phase happens when the intervention is
                        already available in the marketplace. Information can be
                        accessed on both public and private clinical studies on
                        websites such as

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        As previously noted, clinical trials depend on a large
                        number of participants, both those that are affected by
                        the conditions, as well as, healthy participants.
                        Studies show that while people hold positive attitudes
                        toward clinical trials there is a low level of
                        participation. For example, less than 5% of adults with
                        cancer participate in clinical trials related to the
                        illness and only between 5 and 12% of healthy volunteers
                        participate in trials. This is an ongoing issue with
                        clinical trials and is one of the reasons why the trials
                        can take so long to complete. The National Cancer
                        Institute has determined that the two main reasons why
                        cancer patients do not want to participate are fear of
                        getting a placebo and not wanting to be used as “guinea
                        pigs”. Given that clinical trials are a necessary step
                        for
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        developing new and better treatments, participation
                        levels need to increase. Of course, trials must not
                        override the rights and needs of patients, therefore it
                        is of utmost importance that any enrolment is done with
                        as full consent as possible. Because of possible
                        infringement of patients’ rights, doctors are sometimes
                        hesitant to talk to patients about clinical trials. As
                        well, they need to find a balance between giving too
                        little information, which can lead to confusion, and too
                        much information, which can lead to anxiety and perhaps
                        despair. One proposed way on how to circumvent this
                        problem is to focus on motivating possible candidates to
                        actively seek information about clinical trials so that
                        they are better prepared to discuss the information with
                        their doctors and make an informed decision.

                        seek out trials seems to be critical. One study suggests
                        “that patients who use the cognitively effortful
                        information seeking and information-processing
                        decisional strategies are more effective in coping with
                        life-threatening illnesses.” Past research has shown
                        that a lot of individuals who join clinical trials do so
                        not because of information about the study but because
                        they are mostly influenced by “non-rational” factors.
                        These factors include the relationship with their
                        doctor, general beliefs about clinical trials, and even
                        message cues. All this shows the importance of
                        introducing a simple and efficient way for interested
                        parties to access clinical trial databases and find the
                        actual information they need. While there is no single
                        unified

                        worldwide register of trials, ClinicalTrials.gov is the
                        biggest database available with approximately
                        two-hundred and forty thousand registered trials.
                        However, one study shows that it is far from easy to
                        conduct a proper search of this registry or others that
                        are available. The study developed four different search
                        strategies — very precise, precise, sensitive, and very
                        sensitive. These strategies differ on the basis of how
                        many specific conditions and how many specific
                        interventions were mentioned. The study determined that
                        none of the strategies was very good, but that the best
                        results were with the sensitive one. Their conclusion
                        was that the most efficient search approaches, in terms
                        of finding as many of the available relevant trials and
                        the fewest irrelevant trials, remains to be established.
                        The people who are searching for clinical trials have
                        different motives. A number of healthy volunteers are
                        needed, and
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        while their motives might be purely altruistic, at least
                        some see it as a matter of gaining extra income. Indeed,
                        in some trials, individuals are compensated for the risk
                        they take. One website claims that a volunteer can earn
                        hundreds or even thousands of dollars. But, those
                        participants who are affected by the condition in
                        question have many more potential benefits. They will
                        most likely be treated at leading medical facilities
                        often for free and will receive treatment which is not
                        widely available. Moreover, they can take a more active
                        role in their own healthcare, help future generations,
                        and all those suffering from the same condition.
                        Clinical trials are especially important for those
                        suffering from chronic, rare, and life-threatening
                        medical conditions. It should also be noted that not
                        only do the patients receive medical treatment but in
                        cases where the technology has not yet found a cure,
                        clinical trials are helpful as they can provide a better
                        quality of life for those who cannot be fully cured.
                        Furthermore, without clinical trials developing vaccines
                        would be much more difficult. These vaccine studies,
                        while controversial to a degree as they are often
                        conducted in underdeveloped countries which are the most
                        affected ones and involve a number of placebo methods as
                        well, are the number one way of eradicating certain
                        diseases.

                        ClinicalTrials.gov is the biggest registry and it lists
                        262,570 trials from all over the world. As of January
                        01, 2018, it includes 47% Non-US only trials, 36% U.S.
                        only trials, 5% of the trials which are conducted both
                        in the US and Non-US, and 12% are trials where the
                        location is not provided. After the US as the number one
                        country with 107,579 total trials, Europe has around 70
                        thousand trials, and China with around 27 thousand
                        clinical trials. More importantly, out of all of the
                        trials, there are 45,551 studies which are recruiting
                        volunteers. They break down to 57% are outside of the US
                        (25,838), 38% are in the US (17,367) and 5% are both in

                        ClinicalTrials.gov started their registry in 2000 and
                        had only around 5.5 thousand trials in the registry that
                        year. But from 2006 and 2007, there has been a steady
                        sharp rise of registered trials, because of the decision
                        by International Committee of Medical Journal Editors to
                        require trial registration as a condition of publication
                        from 2005, and the FDA expanded registration
                        requirements from the end of 2007.

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        There are currently several million people taking part
                        in clinical trials worldwide.
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        Both private and public sectors are involved in clinical
                        trials. In the US by law, trials can be funded by
                        pharmaceutical companies, academic medical centers, even
                        voluntary groups, as well as Federal agencies such as
                        the National Institute of Health. The costs of running a
                        trial and developing a new medicine are huge and can be
                        in the billions of dollars. Reportedly 60% to 70% of the
                        costs of development are for clinical trials. This
                        amounts to 80 to 90 billion dollars per year. In 2000,
                        it was reported that around 70% of the money from
                        clinical drug trials in the US comes from the
                        pharmaceutical industry and not the public sector. In
                        the EU, the situation is similar where around 61% are
                        sponsored by the pharmaceutical industry and around 39%
                        by non-commercial sponsors. Taking into account the huge
                        prices for developing and the small percent of these
                        medications making it to the market there has even been
                        accusation that the private sector tries influencing the
                        results of the trials.

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        But while it is true that pharmaceutical companies fund
                        trials and they might have their own interests at heart,
                        the companies themselves are not the ones who directly
                        conduct that clinical trials. They are done and tested
                        by independent organizations according to protocols and
                        designs which are approved by the review boards. All the
                        results are in the end reviewed by the regulatory
                        agencies, such as the FDA (US), EMA (Europe), and PMDA
                        (Japan).

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        In the last decade, a lot of those interested in
                        conducting clinical trials have started to outsource
                        them to so-called Contract Research Organizations
                        (CROs). These basically privately-owned companies are
                        specialized in research and help with clinical trials,
                        as well. They provide services for pharmaceutical
                        industries, as well as, governmental institutions. This
                        outsourcing has been a huge trend in the past years and
                        many major corporations are using CROs. Around 50% of
                        CROs perform outsourced clinical trial for the
                        pharmaceutical industry. Using CROs arguably cuts down
                        the costs and time when specific trials are conducted.
                        It is reported that top areas of their research are
                        oncology, metabolic disorders, cardiovascular, and
                        infectious disease. Some of the CROs manage only a part
                        of the trial, for example reviewing the clinical trial
                        data collected by a clinical investigator. Others are
                        specialized in regulatory support, data analysis, or
                        clinical trial management. Bigger CROs offer to manage
                        all aspects of the trials. And while they perform the
                        trial, the sponsor is the one responsible for the
                        integrity of the trial and the data behind it. Cutting
                        costs on the development of new medicine arguably allow
                        pharmaceutical companies not only to lower prices but
                        also to develop drugs and treatments for rare diseases
                        which have a smaller market.

                        Novartis each had almost 1000 active trials, spending

                        CLINICAL TRIALS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES
                     </h3>

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        In the last few years, there has been a shift from
                        conducting clinical trials in developed countries toward
                        those conducted in developing and emerging nations. It
                        is very common that clinical trials are conducted in
                        different countries at the same time. There are
                        different reasons for shifting to developing nations and
                        while there are some practical reasons, as for example
                        to test a vaccine you need the population to be in great
                        number subjected to the disease at hand, there are
                        financial reasons as well. One NGO claims that currently
                        one in every two drugs sold in Switzerland has been at
                        least partly developed on the basis of clinical trials
                        conducted in developing or emerging countries. The
                        reasons they mention for this change is that it’s not
                        only cheaper, but there are much fewer regulations, or
                        at least they not as strict. This fact might lead to a
                        serious breach of ethical standards, however. Almost
                        half of these trials are never made public and therefore
                        we have no idea what kind of risk the volunteers have
                        been subjected to. In their conclusion, they claim that
                        in the case of Switzerland, one of the most developed
                        nations of the world, it is impossible to determine
                        which clinical trials ultimately lead to the approval of
                        specific drugs.
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        A joint study by a number of organizations from December
                        2016 in Egypt illustrates how clinical trials are run in
                        developing countries. Egypt has become a very attractive
                        destination for clinical trials for a number of reasons,
                        leading it to host the most trials in the Middle East
                        and North Africa. The country itself has a good research
                        infrastructure and a fast-growing population, which has
                        been described as “treatment-naïve”. In other words,
                        most of the population is not fully aware of the risks
                        from participating in these trials. The costs in Egypt
                        are also lower than other similar countries. In addition
                        to this, almost 50% of the population has no health
                        insurance and the costs of treatment represent a huge
                        burden on the affected population. This leads to the
                        problematic situation in which poor people are joining
                        clinical trials because this is the only way for them to
                        have access to medical treatment. Even if the results of
                        the trials are not certain and can be risky. This opens
                        the door for possible exploitation of these populations.
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        Luckily, most of the trials are late-stage ones with
                        products which have already been available in developed
                        countries. In fact, this is in accordance with Egyptian
                        laws which only allows testing products that have
                        already been approved in other countries. Still, around
                        16% of the trials in Egypt are in phase 1 and 2. The
                        problem in Egypt is that there is no robust legislation
                        governing trials and the governmental bodies can
                        interpret differently the conditions necessary for the
                        trial to be conducted. Furthermore, one of the biggest
                        problems is that the drugs on trial are not
                        systematically available to most of the population. This
                        fact goes against certain ethical standards by not
                        allowing participants to more freely choose if they want
                        to volunteer in the trial or not.
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        The problems from the example of Egypt are present in
                        many other cases, as well. In 2013, a similar report was
                        presented regarding phase 3 trials in Argentina. Similar
                        to the case of Egypt, a lack of clear legislation rules
                        led to certain companies taking advantage of enrolment
                        of babies in trials who are from very poor segments of
                        the population. Another problem is an improper use of
                        placebo trials and most importantly the discontinuation
                        of treatment after the trial was over, not to mention
                        the lack of any compensation from problems arising from
                        the trials.

                        More reports show that there are no exceptions. One of
                        them reporting on Zimbabwe, stresses the same problem
                        that “limited access to health care and weaknesses in
                        clinical trial oversight in these countries leave room
                        for possible violation of the rights of vulnerable test
                        subjects”. The story is similar as with other cases
                        involving a bad health care system which is incapable of
                        addressing major health challenges, such as a very high
                        morbidity and mortality rate, high levels of almost 15%
                        of adult population is infected with HIV/AIDS,
                        tuberculosis is the second leading disease in Zimbabwe
                        and malaria. The high number of patients is very
                        suitable for clinical trials to be conducted especially
                        in later stages. Trend of moving trials toward the
                        “less-developed” world will only grow for a number of
                        reasons. As previously said, the number of volunteer and
                        participants in developed countries is not very high
                        which makes trials hard to conduct and last longer.
                        While there are clear problems with consent in
                        previously reported cases of Egypt, Argentina, India,
                        and Zimbabwe, it is also clear that recruitment there is
                        much easier and higher in numbers. Sadly, the cost of
                        the studies also dictates where they will be conducted.
                        Lower costs mean moving clinical trials into those areas
                        of the world. It should also be said that legislation in
                        most of these countries does indeed put high obligations
                        towards those conducting the trials, but the general
                        lack of funds put the regulatory commissions in a
                        situation in which they cannot properly do their work.

                        To address the problems of ethical principles in human
                        experimental research there have been different
                        proposals and declarations. The Declaration of Helsinki
                        has been regarded as the most important one, developed
                        by World Medical Association. Sadly, the declaration is
                        still broken in countries where the governmental
                        agencies are unable to fully control the trials.

                     <p class="paragraph">
                        Kathleen Barnard’s story is a powerful example of the
                        potential positive impact that a platform like A
                        Clinical Trials could have. In 2003, Ms. Barnard was
                        told that the lump in her arm was just fatty tissue.
                        However, a second lump turned out to be cancerous. She
                        was diagnosed with Stage 4 Metastatic Melanoma. Her
                        instinct was to fight the cancer even though she was
                        aware of the fatal potential of her diagnosis. After six
                        months of standard treatment including chemotherapy, her
                        cancer had spread to her lung. At this point, her family
                        pushed hard to see if she could get access to
                        experimental treatments. Cost of these treatments was
                        high, but she was able to participate in a clinical
                        trial. This treatment was able to eventually put her
                        cancer into a state of remission. The trial protocol did
                        help her for a time but in 2007 her cancer reemerged. In
                        between her two bouts with cancer, she had become an
                        advocate for treatment options for cancer patients. For
                        her second cancer treatment, she once again accessed
                        newer treatment options. Her advocacy includes dealing
                        directly with the government and the pharmaceutical
                        industry to make treatment options available to cancer
                        patients. She also works to help cancer patients
                        fundraise to cover the cost of their treatment. Had Ms.
                     </p>
                     <p class="paragraph">
                        Barnard had access to a platform such as A Clinical
                        Trials she would have potentially been able to locate
                        and access these experimental treatments quicker. The
                        added elements of assisting with travel set-up and the
                        possibility of help with costs are also aspects of the
                        platform that could have greatly assisted her and other
                        cancer patients. Her cancer journey began in 2003, but
                        her advocacy work shows how many cancer patients still
                        need the help that she struggled to find. This help
                        could potentially exist in the A Clinical Trials
                        platform.
